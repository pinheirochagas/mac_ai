### Coding Homework: Analysis Library for Dementia Patient Data

#### Overview
In this assignment, you are tasked with developing a Python library called `DementiaAnalysis` designed to analyze a simulated dataset containing neuropsychological assessments and basic demographics of a cohort of patients with dementia (`simulated_cognitive_tests_dataset.csv` in `/guides`). This library will help you practice data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using Python. Your library will consist of three modules: `importer`, `viz`, and `stats`. Each module will have specific functions to import data, visualize it, and perform statistical analyses, respectively.

#### Dataset Description
The dataset is a simulated collection of neuropsychological assessments for patients with dementia, including basic demographic information. The data is stored in CSV format and contains the following columns:

- Patient ID
- Age
- Gender
- Diagnosis (e.g., type of dementia)
- Cognitive Test Scores (various metrics)

#### Modules and Functions

##### 1. Importer Module
- **Objective:** Create a function to import CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.
- **Function Name:** `load_data`
- **Input:** File path to the CSV file.
- **Output:** pandas DataFrame containing the dataset.
- **Requirements:** The function should handle exceptions (e.g., file not found) and provide informative error messages.

##### 2. Viz Module
- **Objective:** Develop functions to plot data distribution and visualize group differences and correlations.
- **Function Names and Descriptions:**
  - `plot_distribution`: Plots the distribution of a specified column (e.g., age, test scores).
  - `plot_boxplot`: Creates boxplots to visualize group differences based on a specified categorical variable (e.g., gender, diagnosis).
  - `plot_correlation_matrix`: Generates a correlation matrix plot to visualize correlations between continuous variables.
  - `scatter_plot`: Plots a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Inputs:** pandas DataFrame, column names for plotting, and any other relevant parameters for customization.
- **Output:** Visualization plots.
- **Requirements:** Each function should include parameters for plot customization (e.g., figure size, labels).

##### 3. Stats Module
- **Objective:** Implement functions to easily handle group comparisons and analyze relationships between variables.
- **Function Names and Descriptions:**
  - `perform_ttest`: Conducts a T-test for comparing the means of two groups.
  - `perform_anova`: Performs ANOVA to compare means across multiple groups.
  - `calculate_correlation`: Calculates correlation coefficients between two continuous variables.
  - `perform_regression`: Conducts a linear regression analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- **Inputs:** pandas DataFrame, column names for variables involved in the analysis, and any additional parameters required for the analysis.
- **Output:** Statistical analysis results, including test statistics, p-values, and summary statistics.
- **Requirements:** Functions should check for assumptions where applicable (e.g., normality for T-test) and handle exceptions gracefully.

#### Submission Guidelines
- Include a README.md file with installation instructions and examples of how to use each function.
- Document your code thoroughly, including docstrings for each function describing its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any exceptions handled.
- Test your code with a subset of the dataset to ensure functionality.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality:** The library functions perform as described.
- **Code Quality:** The code is well-organized, commented, and follows Python best practices.
- **Documentation:** The README.md and docstrings provide clear instructions and descriptions.
- **Error Handling:** The code gracefully handles errors and provides informative error messages.


This assignment will test your ability to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data using Python. It will also give you the opportunity to develop a project that could be included in your portfolio. Good luck!
